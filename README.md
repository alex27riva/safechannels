# Channels backup on Umbrel


This is a collection of scripts for backing up all necessary on your Umbrel install. Initial script from Alex Bosworth, I decided to extend the copy on a remote cifs share and for all the 3 important files, not only the channel.db one.

So three different monitoring enabled because of different update times each one has.
